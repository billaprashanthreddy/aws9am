EC2 : Elastic Compute Cloud
		CPU			Cloud
		Memory
		Storage
		GPU
		Application / Software
		Network


Configuration : Guess the capacity : Vendors : 100% along with PO : 3-4 weeks : Installation : OS : Application : UAT : Production

Vertical Scaling : Upgrading same hardware
Horizontal scaling : Distributing the load


On-Demand EC2 Instance : Test the application for the first time, No specific usecases, 
			Pricing : /Sec billing with Min of 60 Sec, No Contract, Monthly

Reserved Instances : For stable workloads, Longtime runs with AWS. 
		Durations : 1 Yr / 3 Yrs

	Standard RI : We canot change the configuration for the duration.
	Convertable RI : We can change the configuration.
  	Scheduled RI : for repeated/persistant requests

	Pricing : Full Upfront : 100% payment while purchasing
		  Partial upfront : Aprox. 30-40% while purchasing, Remaining Monthly
		  No Upfront : Pay Monthly basis

Spot Instances : We must have flexible start / stop, High Config servers at low cost
2 Min warning period, Spot Advisor, Pricing History
We cannot quote more than On-Demand pricing

--> 2 Hr 45 Min , Price is increased, AWS Terminated : 2 Hrs.. 
--> 2 Hr 45 Min, Price not increased, You Terminated instance : 2 Hrs 45 Min.. 

STOP : We can perform stop/start, we will not going to loss any data.
Terminate : Delete

AWS Marketplace : Where we can buy / sell applications.


Launching Windows EC2 Instance : 

1. Select an AMI (Amazon Machine Image : Template of an OS, services and applications) : Windows Server 2012 R2 Base

2. Choose an Instance Type : (t2.micro FREE TIER)

General Purpose : t2, t3		
Compute optimized : c4, c5, c5n, c5d
Memory Optimized : r4, r5, r5d, x1
Storage Optimized : d2, i2, i3
GPU Optimized : P , G

Compute optimized : c4.2xlarge : 8 vCPU, 15 Memory
Memory optimized  : r4.2xlarge : 8 vCPU, 61 Memory


Step 3: Configure Instance Details

--> No Of Instance, Spot, Network (VPC- Default VPC)

Shutdown behavior : STOP / TERMINATE
Enable termination protection : Yes  	(Need to turn off this, when we want to termibate our instance)

Monitoring : Cloudwatch is responsible for Monitoring
	Basic Monitoring : 5 Min (Enabled by defaultly)
	Detailed Monitoring : 1 Min (No Free Tier)


Step 4: Add Storage (EBS) : 30 GB General Purpose SSD

Step 5: Add Tags 

Step 6: Configure Security Group

SG : Firewall at Instance Level. 

(0-65535 Ports / Protocols)

Windows :  RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol):  3389 : 
Linux : SSH (Secure Shell): 22 
http: Port 80 
https : Port 443

Source : 
Custom : We can give any network Ip
MyIP : It picks currently connected networks public IP address
Anywhere : 0.0.0.0/0
